Hi, I am Milan, interested in synthetic biology, precision health, and entrepreneurship. 

I have just started my Interdisciplinary Bioscience DPhil at the Uni of Oxford, where I will be using my first year to find my research area. I am looking for a summer internship in the bay area, tell me if you know good people who could use a hand.

I recently wrapped up my Master's at ETH in the <a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/ctsb">Khammash lab</a>, where I built new molecular tools for synbio circuits based on CRISPR as my thesis work.

#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
